# beh-experiment

This is a sandbox application that plays with the BETH stack (minus Turso, hence BEH Experiment).

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
